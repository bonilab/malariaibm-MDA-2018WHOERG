# Antimalarial Drug Resistance Simulation

This repository contains the figures output and source code for an individual-based
simulation that was a part of the scientific publication titled "Antimalarial
mass drug administration in large populations and the evolution of drug
resistance" published in PLOS Global Public Health in July 2023. This work was
commissioned for a WHO Evidence Review Group (ERG) in September 2018.
